# Getting Started with SPARK MAX

The SPARK MAX is a motor controller that can control both Brushed DC and Brushless DC motors. Out of the box, the MAX defaults to its Brushless Mode and is ready to drive a NEO Brushless Motor with its PWM interface. Included in this section are the basic steps to get a motor spinning using the REV Hardware Client as well as information on how to configure your SPARK MAX.&#x20;

## Before You Start

Before following this guide, the REV Hardware Client should be [Installed](../rev-hardware-client/getting-started-with-the-rev-hardware-client/#installation-instructions) before continuing. The client is the best way to verify that the device is configured correctly, and is _**required**_** **before using the CAN interface.
