# Getting Started with SPARK MAX

{% hint style="info" %}
**We're Updating our Documentation!** For the most up-to-date information about the SPARK MAX and other ION Motor Controllers please check out the following new documentation pages:&#x20;

* [REV ION Brushless ](https://docs.revrobotics.com/brushless)
  * [SPARK MAX Resources](https://docs.revrobotics.com/brushless/links#spark-max-links)
  * [REVLib for SPARK MAX](https://docs.revrobotics.com/brushless/spark-max/revlib)
* [REV Hardware Client Documentation](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/)

The SPARK MAX is a motor controller that can control both Brushed DC and Brushless DC motors. Out of the box, the MAX defaults to its Brushless Mode and is ready to drive a NEO Brushless Motor with its PWM interface. Included in this section are the basic steps to get a motor spinning using the REV Hardware Client as well as information on how to configure your SPARK MAX.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend following this guide in its entirety at least once to understand the key features of the SPARK MAX. This guide can also serve as a fallback in case of any issues faced.

## Before You Start

Before following this guide, the REV Hardware Client should be [Installed](../rev-hardware-client/getting-started-with-the-rev-hardware-client/#installation-instructions) before continuing. The client is the best way to verify that the device is configured correctly, and is _**required**_ before using the CAN interface.
